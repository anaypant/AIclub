Hello World!


This is my AI Competition Class for AIClub!

In this folder, you will find 3 files: main.py, plot.py, and Food Dataset Generic.csv.

If you want to use this app, please note that you will have to have all three files in the SAME folder (no subfolders.)


******************************************

MAIN.PY:
##########
This is the main application! In this app, the program will ask the user to log their tastes / foods! This will be used to train the AI.

After the user terminates the training phase (Either by "Yes", or "yes"), then the Ai trains! Then, based on some more questions, you can get a food to eat!



PLOT.PY:
###################
This program shows the distribution of food selections based on their food type.

The plot will adjust based on your inputs.



FOOD DATASET.CSV:
##################
This is the csv that is used for you!
This dataset is also changed live, so it will add whatever your new input is.
You can also manually add inputs in the csv (just be careful!)
